  ## Project Description

ABC GOAT is a learning app that teaches kids to read while playing games and having fun!   
The game offers a play ground where the user can play a word guessing game, or just say words and see pictures associated with the word pop up!  
The Practice Letters page allows the user to learn the alphabet through various activities, such as hearing each letter, learning each letter's sound, and then practicing them.  There is also a Spelling Game that the user can play.
