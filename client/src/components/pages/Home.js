      <p>ABC GOAT is a learning app that teaches kids to read while playing games and having fun! Start in the Play Ground area where you can play a word guessing game as well as search for words you may not know how to spell. Just say the word you are thinking and it will pop up! There is also an area to practice your letters. It will take you through the alphabet and teach you the names of the letters and the order of the alphabet. When you are ready head on over to the Spelling Game and ask yourself, "Are you ready to achieve G.R.O.A.T. status?" G.R.O.A.T stands for Greatest reader of all time! See if you can spell all the words before time runs out! Good luck!</p>
